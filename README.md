Current Song Playing - Applescript version.
=====================
Current Song Playing (CSP) made in applescript.

ABOUT
-----
CSP is a small script that updates a text file with the current song playing obtained by automatically checking which player (iTunes or Spotify currently supported) is playing music. This is useful for streaming services such as XSplit or OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)!

Running
-------
open Terminal and navigate to where you downloaded the script and run
> ./run.sh

or create your own way!

Currently, the CSP file is located in the same folder as the script, called "CurrentSongPlaying.txt"

Pull Requests
-------------
I'm happily take pull requests, but make sure to include an updated version of the applescript in plain-text!
This can be done by export to text inside the Script Editor.

Inspired by SNIP
----------------
Found SNIP when searching for ways to put currently playing song on my screen when streaming, but it was in windows-format, so i made my own!
