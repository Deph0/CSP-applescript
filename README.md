# Current Song Playing - Applescript version.
Current Song Playing (CSP) made in applescript.

#ABOUT
CSP is a small script that updates a text file with the current song playing obtained by automatically checking which player (iTunes or Spotify currently supported) is playing music. This is useful for streaming services such as XSplit or OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)!

#Running
open Terminal and navigate to where you downloaded the script and run
> ./run.sh
or create your own way!

Currently, the current song playing file is located on your Desktop, called "CurrentSongPlaying.txt"
This is likely to change to same folder as the script is in.
